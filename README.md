# Movie-Clustering
Movie clustering / recommender system (unsupervised learning)

This research project was completed for Thinkful's Data Science Flex program as an Unsupervised Learning Capstone. The models, in essence, are the basis of movie recommender systems.

Cluster visualization and analysis requires extensive plotting, much of it in 3-D. Cell outputs had to be cleared to prevent exceeding GitHub's file size limit. Please be sure to install any requisite libraries before running this notebook.
